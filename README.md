# VikNGS - Variant Integration Kit for NGS

VikNGS was designed for association analysis of next generation sequencing data integrated across different studies. Combining cohorts with systematic differences in read depth can result in spurious association results. VikNGS features a robust variance score test (vRVS) which uses expected genotypes rather than hard genotype call. 

VikNGS also provides a simulation component which can be used to analyze Type I error or power under different experimental designs, varying sample sizes and with different types of association tests.
